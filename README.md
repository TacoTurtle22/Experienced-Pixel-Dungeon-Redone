# Experienced Pixel Dungeon

Experienced Pixel Dungeon (Redone) (Redone again) is an open-source kinda grindy traditional roguelike dungeon sandbox with randomized levels, enemies and opportunities to abuse the game, and hundreds of items to collect and grind for. Its based on the [source code of Experienced Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/TrashboxBobylev/Experienced-Pixel-Dungeon-Redone), by TrashboxBobylev.

Experienced Pixel Dungeon Redone x2 currently compiles for Android and Desktop platforms. You can find official releases of the game on:
